## EVM E2E Gateway Tests

EVM gateway end-to-end tests use web3.js client to interact with the evm gateway.
Web3.js client is used to ensure 100% compliance with the JSON-RPC API specification, 
and it allows us to detect any mistakes in how the data is returned from the API.

### Running Tests
**Locally**

Running the test is done simply by running the test file:
```
go test ./e2e_web3js_test.go
```

**Running against deployed EVM gateway**

A nice feature of e2e web3.js tests is that they can also be run against a deployed 
evm gateway. You just need to change the host used in the JS tests.


### Adding new E2E tests
Adding a new test is done simply by adding a new JS test file to the web3js folder and then 
adding execution of that test in the e2e_web3js_test.go. 

**EOA Test Account**

Tests can use a predefined test account that is funded with 5 Flow:
- Address: `0xFACF71692421039876a5BB4F10EF7A439D8ef61E`
- Private Key: `0xf6d5333177711e562cabf1f311916196ee6ffc2a07966d9d4628094073bd5442`


❗️ Keep in mind that if you want to have 
An isolated and new instance of the gateway you need to separate tests in a new file. Each test 
file will be run with a fresh instance of evm gateway, but tests that are written in the same file 
will share the evm gateway instance and any state established by the test.

**Example:**

Let's say we want to add a new e2e test called `getBlock` we add a new file to `web3js/getBlock.js`. 
Inside that file we define any assertions we want to make, then we add this test 
to the `e2e_web3js_test.go` like so:
```go
func Test_Web3Acceptance(t *testing.T) {
    runWeb3Test(t, "getBlock")
}
```

### Producing fixtures
Files in the `fixtures` folder can be produced by using a `solc` compiler or simply by 
using [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) online IDE. You can simply paste the `test.sol`, 
change it the way you see fit and compile, which will produce ABI JSON and compiled binary. 
You then replace contents of `test-abi.json` with new ABI and `test.bin` with the compiled binary.

### Running live network tests

Make sure that you are in the `flow-evm-gateway/tests/live-networks` directory and run the
following commands:

```bash
npm install

RPC_HOST="previewnet" USER_PRIVATE_KEY="0xMyPrivateKey" npm run test
```
